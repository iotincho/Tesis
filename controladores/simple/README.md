# Tesis
a complete implementation of UGV with collision avoidance system

# Folder
this folder contains a complete implementation of the "Simple , Realtime obstacle avoidance Algorithm" descrived in the referenced paper. It was tested within the world in sim_player/simple (branch 'simulacion_player').

# Notes
The algorith doesn't work. It has several structural problems avoiding obstacles in front of the robot, so I gess the results exposed in the paper are not real.
